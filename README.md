# ShellX — Cognitive Developer Engine

ShellX is a goal-driven cognitive developer engine that helps you understand what you're building, why you're building it, and how far along you are. It uses a persistent memory system called **LinkX** to produce safe, incremental, traceable operations.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g shellx-dev-cli
```

## Quick Start

```bash
shellx init
shellx linkx init
shellx --xx "stabilize the rendering pipeline"
shellx linkx show
```

## What ShellX does

ShellX turns complex developer workflows into structured output:

- Summary Report
- Detailed Report
- Full Report
- LinkX memory entry
- Stone snapshot

All from a single command.

## Core Concepts

### Triple-Context Engine
ShellX evaluates every request using three layers of context:

1. **Immediate Intent** — what you asked for
2. **Long-Term Goal** — stored in LinkX
3. **Actual Project State** — scanned from the codebase

ShellX reconciles all three before taking action, ensuring correctness, continuity, and safety.

### LinkX — Core Memory System
LinkX is the primary memory and goal engine of ShellX.
ShellX boots on top of LinkX and relies on it for context-aware execution.

LinkX stores:

- Project goal
- Project constraints
- Project preferences
- Project state
- Intent history
- Context model
- Stones (restore points)

If LinkX is unavailable, ShellX enters safe mode and refuses destructive operations.

### Builder Mode
ShellX performs safe, incremental modifications:

- Adds
- Extends
- Fixes
- Improves

ShellX does not overwrite, replace, destroy, misplace, or duplicate unless explicitly instructed.

### Superman Mode
Superman orchestrates workers and performs deep diagnostics:

- Loads LinkX
- Confirms the project goal
- Scans the codebase
- Reconciles context
- Runs workers safely
- Updates LinkX
- Creates a Stone

Superman is powerful, precise, and goal-aware.

## Getting Started

### Global install

```bash
npm install -g shellx-dev-cli
```

### Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jimgranitex-eng/Shellx.git
cd Shellx
npm install
node bin/shellx.js --version
```

## Commands

### Initialize ShellX

```bash
shellx init
```

Creates `.linkx/`, `.reports/`, and `.stones/`.

### Initialize LinkX

```bash
shellx linkx init
```

Initializes the persistent memory system.

### LinkX commands

```bash
shellx linkx scan
shellx linkx show
shellx linkx timeline
```

### Verify installation

```bash
shellx verify
```

### Generate reports

```bash
shellx report
shellx report --format detailed
shellx report --format full
```

### Cognitive mode

```bash
shellx --xx "your intent here"
```

Example:

```bash
shellx --xx "Fix the rendering pipeline and optimize the shader system"
```

## In One Sentence

**ShellX is a cognitive developer engine that preserves long-term project goals, analyzes your codebase, and performs safe, incremental operations using a persistent memory system called LinkX.**
